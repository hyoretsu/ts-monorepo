# Agent Guidelines

> Single source of truth for every coding agent (Codex, Claude Code, others). Rules specific to a package or app live in that directory's own `AGENTS.md`; repeatable procedures live in skills under `.agents/skills/` (symlinked into `.claude/skills/`); hooks share one script in `scripts/agent-hooks/` wired per agent. Add new agent configuration to these shared locations, never to an agent-specific one.

## Read first

- [`docs/business-rules.md`](docs/business-rules.md): product/domain rules.
- [`docs/engineering-rules.md`](docs/engineering-rules.md): template stack, shared components and infrastructure invariants. Read before implementation or review. When adapting this template to a new project, update that file to the real stack; never copy another application's rules blindly.
- **Nested `AGENTS.md` files.** Agents are normally started from the repository root, where nested files are not guaranteed to load. Before reading or editing anything in a directory, read every `AGENTS.md` between the repository root and that directory that you have not read yet, whatever the directory is called. List them with `git ls-files '*AGENTS.md'`. Their rules add to this file and win on conflicts inside their directory.
- Keep this file for workflow and cross-package rules. Do not copy domain examples or nonexistent paths from another project; instructions must name real scripts, hooks, paths and components.

## Skills

Load the matching skill before starting that kind of task:

| Skill                      | When                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task-worktree`            | Local sessions: start any implementation task in an isolated worktree and integrate it back. |
| `ui-screenshot-validation` | Any interface change, before reporting completion.                                           |
| `backend-endpoint-sdk`     | Adding or changing an endpoint, DTO or response; regenerating the frontend SDK.              |
| `tanstack-route-files`     | Adding, moving or renaming files under `frontend/src/routes`.                                |

## Local boundary (local sessions)

When running on the user's machine, never perform an action whose effect leaves it unless the user explicitly asks for that specific action:

- `git push`, creating/updating PRs, pushing tags.
- Migrations, schema pushes, seeds or any command against a remote/shared/external database.
- Triggering CI/CD, deploys or remote jobs; publishing packages; mutating external services.

Local work is fine: edit files, run local builds/tests, commit locally. If a task needs to cross the boundary, describe the exact command and ask first.

Cloud/remote sessions have an ephemeral container and cannot rely on the user pushing: follow the environment's own instructions (push the designated branch, open a draft PR). Never run migrations against a remote/shared database from any session without explicit authorization.

## Commits

After every completed task, commit with the local Git user as author and committer and a `Co-authored-by:` trailer for the agent:

```
git commit -m "..." -m "Co-authored-by: <Agent> <agent-email>"
```

On the user's machine add `-c commit.gpgsign=false`. Cloud sessions keep their preconfigured signing: disabling it makes GitHub show the commits as Unverified.

- Claude → `Co-authored-by: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`; Codex → `Co-authored-by: Codex <noreply@openai.com>`.
- On the user's machine the agent is only ever a co-author: never set it as author/committer, and do not pass `--author` or override `user.name`/`user.email`. Cloud sessions already run with the agent's own Git identity preconfigured; leave it as is and still add the trailer.
- Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `chore`) scoped by package (`feat(frontend)`, `fix(backend)`).
- Atomic: one commit = one coherent, revertible change. Revert formatter edits outside your change. Prefer several small commits.
- Always split hunks: when a file already has uncommitted changes you did not make, stage only your own hunks (`git add -p`, or `git apply --cached` with a filtered patch) and commit just those. Never bundle the user's work-in-progress into your commit; leave it unstaged.
- Adjustments to something just delivered amend or rebase instead of adding noise.
- Validation is hook-driven (Lefthook `lefthook.yml` pre-commit → `scripts/validate-staged.ts` plus lint-staged). Do not run format/lint/type-check as manual pre-commit steps; fix hook failures at the root cause and commit again. Never bypass with `--no-verify` or `LEFTHOOK=0`.

## Agent changes

Any change related to agents (instructions, skills, hooks or configuration) must support at least **Codex and Claude Code**. Keep shared behavior in agent-neutral sources and wire it into both agents; do not implement it for only one. Apply the corresponding change to the template at `/home/hyoretsu/Projects/ts-monorepo` and to the global instructions for both agents in the same task. In the template, put cross-project directives only in the root `AGENTS.md`, not in package-level guidelines. The template is the source of truth when shared rules diverge; preserve each project's actual domain and stack specifics.

## Plans

Only large features executed in Plan mode need a plan. `docs/` is product/domain knowledge; `plans/` is execution history organized by lifecycle:

- `plans/`: only newly created or in-progress plans.
- `plans/done/`: completed plans. Move the plan here when all steps are complete.
- `plans/discarded/`: abandoned, rejected or superseded plans. Record why they were discarded and link a replacement when applicable; never mark them completed just to archive them.

Name plans `NNNN-kebab-slug.md`, using the next sequential number across all three locations; never reuse an archived plan's number. Preserve the filename when moving a plan, update references and relative links, and commit the move with the corresponding completion or discard update. When resuming, read the existing plan wherever it is; if reopened, move it back to `plans/`. After each completed step, update progress and commit that update with the step's changes.

## Pre-PR / pre-merge

Run type-check and build for affected packages before a PR or merge. Pre-commit runs `scripts/validate-staged.ts` for staged packages and dependents plus staged formatting/linting; pre-push builds affected packages; CI runs affected builds/types and the disposable integration/E2E scenarios. Do not add unit tests, coverage or unit-test gates to this template. No local check authorizes push, deploy or remote database operations.

## Structure and naming

**File naming follows responsibilities.** Components, classes, use cases and DTO schemas use PascalCase: `AuthTabs.tsx`, `LoginForm.tsx`, `FormField.tsx`. Utilities, hooks and configs use kebab-case. Preserve established directory structures and their index barrels. Avoid unrelated renames.

## Tests

- The template has integration and E2E tests only; do not add unit tests or coverage gates.
- Backend integration/E2E files live in `backend/tests/`; SQL scenarios in `packages/sql/tests/`, ending in `.integration.test.ts` or `.e2e.test.ts`; repo scripts in `scripts/tests/`. Browser scenarios live in `frontend/tests/browser/`; external browser performance checks in `frontend/tests/performance/`. Never name a folder `__tests__` or any `__…__` form.
- Backend runs on Bun: `bun:test` through the disposable runner (`scripts/test-runner.ts`), never against remote/shared databases.
- Ephemeral test services: the runner uses `DATABASE_DEV_URL` (or `POSTGRES_DEV_URL`), `REDIS_DEV_URL` and `RABBITMQ_DEV_URL` (set globally or in `.env`) when present, and starts a Docker container for each one that is missing. On an existing server it only creates and removes its own resources and never touches existing ones: Postgres gets a random uniquely named database (any database name in the URL is ignored), Redis keys and RabbitMQ queues/exchanges are namespaced per run and deleted afterwards.

## i18n - Mandatory Rule

The translation files in [frontend/src/i18n/locales/](frontend/src/i18n/locales/) **must remain synchronized**. Today only `en-US.json` exists.

**Every time you add, rename, or remove a key, apply the change to ALL locale files in the same operation.** Never leave one locale behind another, even if the final translation still needs review - in that case, use the fallback-language string as a placeholder and leave a comment in the PR, but ensure the key structure is identical across files.

- The fallback locale is the ground truth for types (see `frontend/src/i18n/types.d.ts`).
- Keys inside JSON files follow alphabetical order (linter rule).
- When introducing a new namespace, register it in `frontend/src/i18n/config.ts` and in `types.d.ts`.

### Enums Are Frontend-Translatable Contracts

Backend status/error enums (e.g. KYC status, bet status, payout status, error codes) exist to give the frontend predictability: the frontend translates the enum value, it never renders the raw value to the user. Whenever you add or change an enum member on the backend, add the matching translation key to **all** locale files in the same change, and render it through `t()` with the raw value as `defaultValue` (e.g. ``t(`kyc.status.${user.kycStatus}`, { defaultValue: user.kycStatus })``). Never render a raw enum value in the UI.

## Enforced rules

Not repeated elsewhere:

- `bun run lint` (see `eslint.config.mjs`) fails on: `React.` namespace/`import * as React`, `<input type="number|checkbox|date|datetime-local|month|week">`, native `<select>`, `alert`/`confirm`, `t.Intersect`.
- Edits to generated files (`frontend/src/lib/api/generated/`, `backend/generated/`, `frontend/src-tauri/gen/`, `packages/sql/out/`, `*.gen.ts`) are blocked before they happen by `scripts/agent-hooks/block-generated-edits.ts`, wired for Claude Code in `.claude/settings.json` and for Codex in `.codex/hooks.json`. Regenerate instead (`backend-endpoint-sdk` skill, frontend build). Keep both configs pointing at the same script.

## Documentation follows implementation

Shared rules describe invariants; repository-specific sections describe the actual stack and exceptions. Keep business rules in `docs/business-rules.md` and engineering rules in `docs/engineering-rules.md`.

## Development guides

Before creating a workspace or changing workspace dependencies, exports or Turbo tasks, read [the project scaffolding guide](docs/development/project-scaffolding.md). Find development guides under `docs/development/` and read those applicable to the change; keep discovery links here when adding new ones. CD setup and release operations: [continuous delivery guide](docs/development/cd.md).
